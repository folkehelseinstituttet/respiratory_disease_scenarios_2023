# respiratory_disease_scenarios_2023
Scenarios for covid-19 and influenza for the winter 23/24 developed by NIPH for the risk evaluation published on the 30th of November 2023 and available [here](https://www.fhi.no/contentassets/e9dfa504595742d4a6b9d05a1d42ac3d/risikovurdering-2023-11-30.pdf)

To generate the results run `run_analysis.R` after setting the number of threads in the variable at the top of the script. 

In the `plot_results.R` script we plot all the figures used in the report attached to the risk evaluation. The results for the influenza scenarios are not included so these figure will not be possible to generate.
